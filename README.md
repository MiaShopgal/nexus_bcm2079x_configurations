# NFC Routing to SIM card SE on Nexus phones


#### Contents
This repository contains working examples for the config files used by the BRCM 2079x NFC chipset (as used in Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 phones) with Secure Element Routing configured to use the UICC (SIM card) instead of the internal secure element. Tested on Android 6.0.


#### Background
You may need this if you use your phone as a banking card with the banking card installed into your SIM (for example, like the [Bankomatkarte mobil](https://www.bankomatkarte-mobil.at/) in Austria).
